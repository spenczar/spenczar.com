  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>
    I'm Spencer, and I'm currently a software engineer at
    <a href="http://www.twitch.tv">Twitch</a>. I started my time there building
    a data science team. Now, my focus is on building tools to help stability
    and reliability at Twitch.
  </p>
  <p>
    I write a lot of <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a> these days, but my first
    love was Python, and I still occasionally dip back into that
    world.
